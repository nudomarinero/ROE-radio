# Observing the radio sky from the Royal Observatory

The project consists on the commissioning of a state of the art radio astronomy station for student training and research.

The detailed description of the project proposal can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/project.html)

It was mainly developed by Sean Johnston and Jose Sabater through the summer of 2018. Two projects were succesfully tested: the detection of meteor scatter and the measurement of the Milky Way atomic gas emission.

The station is ready to be used for future student training and to run projects. There is some future work that is still under development:
* the automatic processing of data using GPUs.
* the refinement of the tested projects.
* the development of new radio astronomy projects not yet tested.

This page will be updated with these future developments.
