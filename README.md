# Observing the radio sky from the Royal Observatory

## Project overview
State of the art radio astronomy station for student training and research 

## Project details

The aim is to build and set up a radio astronomy station for the training of students and the development of research projects. The station will be located in the Royal Observatory. The main final goal is to develop innovative and feasible projects for university students at different levels of their formation. A secondary goal is the long term gathering of data with research purposes (monitorization of physical phenomena like auroras, meteor trails, and the ionosphere).

New data intensive infrastructures for science, like the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), present a huge challenge due to the amount of data produced and the need to develop innovative workflows for the data calibration. The recent availability of cheap Software Defined Radio (SDR) receivers makes possible the exploration of these new aspects of scientific research in a practical and inexpensive way. 

We will explore, adapt, and design a series of projects that can be performed with the station:
* Measurement of Milky Way atomic gas
* Sun transit and equation of time
* Solar activity
* Jupiter auroral activity
* Pulsar detection
* Meteor scatter
* Ionospheric monitoring
* Auroral monitoring
* Cosmic rays detection
* analysis of GPS raw signal
* Satellite detection and characterization
* Storm detection
* Navigation and flight traffic statistics
* Earth-Moon-Earth signal detection
* Spatial weather musicalization

The station requires a SDR radio receiver and a set of antennas for different radio bands. A pre-amplifier and cables are required to boost and conduct the faint radio signals. The radio signal must be pre-processed by a computing back-end (a Raspberry Pi computer or similar) and stored in a hard drive for further processing.

We also request funding for one summer student to participate on the set-up and commissioning of the station during the summer of 2018.

## Significant results and benefits

The most significant benefit is the training of students in new astronomy techniques. The projects developed will focus on the new aspects of modern astronomy like data management and processing which would offer to the students an approach that is closer to current procedures. This will provide them with skills that are directly relevant to the new data-intensive methods. 

The proposed project will explore and develop different training and research projects (outlined in the previous section) and generate formal guides for the students. These projects can be developed as Senior Honours projects or summer studentships projects but the most interesting ones have the potential to be structured as a Telescope Group Project in the future. 

Another benefit is the use of the station for research projects yet to explore. The radio station can be easily automated to gather data for long periods of time without the need of supervision. That makes the station suitable for long term monitoring of physical phenomena. We expect to monitor meteor scatter, auroral and ionospheric activity, and Solar System activity.

The station have the potential to be used in other fields (physics, engineering) and not just astronomy and even as part of interdisciplinary projects. One example is the possible use of data for artistic projects like the musicalization of space weather radio signals (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgtuaQWdcGA). The data and guides of some suitable projects will be made publicly available. 

There is an opportunity for a future expansion to more challenging techniques like interferometry but also to the application of innovative techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence to the processing of the radio data. 

## Innovative or unique about the project

Typical astronomy projects in universities around the world focus on optical astronomy. This project will build a radio observatory, which is uncommon. There are some SDR experiments in universities focused on telecommunications and engineering but the use of SDRs for astronomy in university projects is innovative.

Some of the proposed training and research projects are very challenging but have the potential to bring innovative results both in teaching and in research. For example, the detection of pulsars has never been possible with small dish antennas but the power of new SDR receivers, like the one planned for this project, offer the potential to make it possible with a modest size dish. 

One unique advantage of radio-observations is that they are not much affected by tropospheric weather (clouds, rain...) which is a big advantage given the Scottish weather.

The use of SDR radio data allows to focus the training projects in the new aspects of astronomy. The data centric focus of this type of station is different to that of many other projects. Furthermore, the possibility of automation offers an unique opportunity for the gathering of long term data without human intervention.

## Feasibility of the project

Although the approach is innovative there are no technical impediments that could render the project infeasible. All the materials and components (receivers, antennas, cables, etc.) are easily available from different commercial sources. The few pieces that cannot be commercially sourced are easy to build and offer an opportunity for practical hands-on projects. 

The location of the Royal Observatory on top of a hill is ideal for a radio astronomy station as it has a clear view of the sky. Some radio observations can be carried out at night and some during the day. Most of the observations are not particularly affected by the weather conditions. 

The applicant has experience in the supervision of students (Senior Honours, summer students, etc.) as well as experience in data processing and radio astronomy. The station can be easily run without the help of the applicant once it is set up.
